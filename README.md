Molecular Docking of XKW Ligand with 8F9Z Protein

Objective
Performed molecular docking of XKW ligand with 8F9Z protein using AutoDock Vina (v1.2.7) to evaluate binding affinity and possible binding modes.

Tools & Skills
- AutoDock Vina (command line)
- PyMOL visualization
- Structure preparation (PyMOL, AutoDock Tools) for PDB/PDBQT files
- Grid box definition
- Docking pose analysis
- Hydrogen bond analysis

Docking Results
- Best binding affinity: −7.732 kcal/mol (mode 1)
- Total binding modes: 10
- Exhaustiveness: 16
- Grid center: (−1.5, −16.7, 11.9)
- Grid size: 23 × 23 × 23 Å
- RMSD range: 0–4.347 Å (upper bound)

Visualization
Docked pose of XKW ligand in 8F9Z protein showing hydrogen bond interactions (2.2–3.7 Å) visualized using PyMOL.

Grid Optimization Strategy
- Theoretical grid (PyMOL): 30 × 27 × 35 Å (82×73×94 points)
- Optimized grid (used): 23 × 23 × 23 Å (61×61×61 points)
- Volume reduction: 57.1%
- Rationale: Maintained accuracy while improving computational efficiency
- Outcome: Excellent binding affinity (−7.732 kcal/mol) confirmed grid adequacy

Key Findings
1. Mode 1 was selected as the best pose based on strongest binding affinity.
2. Mode 4 shows close structural similarity (RMSD 1.835 Å) with good affinity (−7.518 kcal/mol).
3. All modes demonstrate strong binding (< −6.9 kcal/mol), with the top 5 modes exceeding −7.5 kcal/mol.
4. The optimized grid size focused the search space, yielding structurally consistent results
